# Context Overview

## Current Work Focus

Memory Bank Initialization: Thoroughly analyzing the project to create comprehensive documentation for `product.md`, `architecture.md`, `tech.md`, `context.md`, and `brief.md`.

## Recent Changes

-   `product.md` created, outlining the project's purpose and user experience goals.
-   `architecture.md` created, detailing the system architecture, source code paths, key technical decisions, design patterns, and component relationships.
-   `tech.md` created, describing the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, and dependencies.

## Next Steps

1.  Populate `brief.md` with a concise summary of the project.
2.  Ask the user to review the initialized memory bank files for accuracy and completeness.
